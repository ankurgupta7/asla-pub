## Analysis of Machine Learning Aspect of the project

This is mainly a '*repo*' for all the code used for our machine learning analysis.
asla will use the classifier and configurations that performs best, based on the cross-validation error
The cross validation error is calculated using leave one group out. Group here signifies a single persons data.
All training/test data used for analysis will be stored in data folder.
