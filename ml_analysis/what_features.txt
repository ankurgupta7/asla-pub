# FINGERS
extended_fingers - 5
rel_finger_lengths - 5 (Currently only captured for extended fingers, by calculating dist from palm center and tip, can use distance_to)
rel_inner_distances - 10
mcp_length - 5
rel_inner_mcp_distances - 10
pip_length - 5
rel_inner_pip_distances - 10
dip_length - 5
rel_inner_dip_distances - 10
angles_between_tips - 10 (Vector.angle_to)
finger_palm_angle - 5 (Angle between fingers and palm plane)

# HAND
palm_direction - 3
palm_radius - 1 (sphere_radius)
palm_grab - 1 (grab_strength)
palm_pinch - 1 (pinch_strength)
palm_normal - 3
palm_velocity - 3 # Skeptical
sphere_center - 3
wrist_position - 3


# Moving Gestures (calculated as difference between first and last frame):
rotation_angle - 3 (need to specify frame(starting) and axis)
translation - 3 (change in position in millimeters)
extended_tip_pos_diff - 3 (from starting frame)


# To Calibrate:
max_tip_length
max_mcp_length
max_pip_length
max_dip_length
# (Between thumb and little finger)
inner_tip_distance
inner_dip_distance
inner_pip_distance
inner_mcp_distance


Features:

- extended fingers - 5d vector(boolean, 0-not extended,1- extended)
- scaled tip distance, 5d vector (this would mean to add calibration to record scale factor(mostly middle finger)
- inner tip distance, 10d vector ( distance between all fingers)
- palm direction
- palm sphere radius
- grab strength
- pinch strength

Out:
- relative tip positions (tip positions relative to palm center)

Notes:
If we are taking movements/gestures, then we need to tell the expert when to make the movement(Basically when we start capturing data)!
