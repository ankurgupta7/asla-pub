Draft on what features to select/extract

Features:

- extended fingers - 5d vector(boolean, 0-not extended,1- extended) 
- scaled tip distance, 5d vector (this would mean to add calibration to record scale factor(mostly middle finger)
- inner tip distance, 10d vector ( distance between all fingers) 
- palm direction
- palm sphere radius
- grab strength
- pinch strength

Out:
- relative tip positions (tip positions relative to palm center)
